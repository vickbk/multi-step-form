## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type safety
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build tool and dev server
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) - Icon library

### What I learned

This project helped me practice building a complex multi-step form with React and TypeScript. Key learnings include:

- Managing complex form state across multiple steps
- Implementing form validation with proper error handling
- Creating a responsive layout that works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
- Using React hooks effectively for state management
- Implementing proper navigation between form steps with the ability to go back and edit

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects:

- Advanced form validation patterns and error handling strategies
- Accessibility improvements for complex form interactions
- Performance optimization for larger forms
- Implementing animation and transitions between steps
- Testing strategies for complex UI flows

### Useful resources

- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/) - Essential for understanding React hooks and best practices
- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) - Helpful for type definitions and type safety
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Great reference for utility classes and responsive design
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Comprehensive resource for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
